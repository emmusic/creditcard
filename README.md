Analysis of Taiwan Credit Default dataset

Mike and I cleaned up this dataset with the intention of predicting client default status. We used the old classic machine learning standbys Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, then tried out the evolution of DT, XGBoost, as this model is getting a lot of attention on Kaggle competitions these days. When using F1 as an evaluation metric, XGB performed best. When using ROC as the evaluation metric, Logistic Regression had better performance. We also used Deep Learning and it made my laptop catch fire.
